* About
This is a work in progress project aiming to emulate as much of vim as possible in QMK userspace. The idea is to use clever combinations of shift, home, end, and control + arrow keys to emulate vim's modal editing and motions.

The other goal is to make it relatively plug and play in user keymaps, while still providing customization options.
